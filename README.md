Graph Theory Project ~ Bi-directional weighted graph    
This graph data structure is driven by a vector of LinkedList pointers. [NodeCentric AdjacencyList]

Download, compile, run. (rec: g++)

Main.h has TESTCASES if you want to pump those rookie numbers up.   
See bottom of main.cpp loop for instructions if your computer is too fast for srand()


This project could use some polishing as well as a web UI. Would be neat to drag-and-drop graph verticies/edges in a desktop or browser app since the back end is already done. All in all this graph class showcases the softskills learned in this 200/2000level Data Structures class, while also demonstrating technical competency. I had no reference of loose/tight cuppling, interface seperation, CLI familiarity, or memory management skills. I'm certainly no programmer/developer yet, but as promised by my professor, I can hardly recongnize my code from six months back. If you are reading this, I welcome all constructive critisim with utter apathy to my emotions.
